# added BWC - Bridge Deck Sidewalk Concrete - BSW is depreciated
# added BSS - Bridge Structural Steel
# added BSC - Bridge Scupper
# added BDP - Bridge Deck Plate
# change BPA from 624 to 633 and eliminated 'required Comment'"PARAPET'
# depreciated edge of pavement/edge of shoulder combinations used on IL-83 (fail). ERB-EWC.
# depreciated RNW Runway
# depreciated 667 as IDOT code for crown (CRB/CRC) using breakline 607 with material comments for 
  # pavement areas with no stripeing - use stripeing as breakline where possible
# Crown now has material types: CNB = HMA, CNC = CONC, etc. - see 667 above
# I'm going to stop using the B6B codes and start using CRB on all curbs unless they are 
  # odd (not B6.12 or B6.24).  Use the IDOT codes of odd curbs. - LV - The B6B and B62 will still
  # work.
# Changed BBA/BBB/BBC/BBR from 619 to 621 so that spots land on the Topo_BridgeStructures level
# added BUC - Building Commercial - BLD is being depreciated
# added BUP - Building Public - BLD is being depreciated
# added BUR - Building Residential - BLD is being depreciated
# changed RR centerline from CLR to RCL

# Process_8 had many improvements - however I also migrated to "Mapping Codes"
# (instead of "Line Codes") as an option in Geopak.  Using the "Mapping Codes" I was
# finally able to get the curves to work. These codes also needed to be at the beginning of 
# code like BL*EOP1.
#
# But the Mapping Code option forced the lines to be created in
# point number order.  This caused problems in processing.  It ignored 
# the order of the points in the ASCII file.
# For example, say you missed an EOP1 shot on a cross section and went back to it at the
# next set up.
# Now to draw that line correctly using the "Line Coding" option you can reorder the records in
# the ASCII file like:
# 1,1000,1000,EOP1,L
# 2,1000,1010,EOP1,
# 40,1000,1020,EOP1,
# 3,1000,1030,EOP1,
#
# In the "Mapping Codes" option, the order of the ASCII file is ignored and the EOP1 are sorted
# so that the line goes 1,2,3,40.
#
# This was too big of a complication to screw with; we would need to RENUMBER points to 
# get the line to draw correctly.
# So this version has the latest code changes (MPS_IDOTCodes_V02_15.xlsx) and reverts back to 
# processing with the "Line Coding" option.
